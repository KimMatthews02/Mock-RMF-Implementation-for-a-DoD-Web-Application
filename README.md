# Mock RMF Implementation for DoD Web Application

This repository demonstrates a mock implementation of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) for a fictional Department of Defense web application. It is structured to reflect each of the six RMF steps and includes simulated documents such as system categorization, control selection, STIG compliance, eMASS package visuals, ACAS scan samples, and a POA&M.

## üîê Tools and Frameworks Used
- DISA STIG Viewer
- eMASS (mocked screenshots)
- ACAS (simulated Nessus reports)
- NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5
- POA&M Templates
- Excel & Markdown Documentation

## üìä Purpose
Designed to showcase my understanding of RMF implementation and cybersecurity compliance in a DoD environment, this project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate eligibility for federal ISSO/ISSM roles.
